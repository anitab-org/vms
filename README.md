Systers Portal - VMS project
============================

Systers has many volunteers that offer their skills, time, and commitment to
our vision and projects. The **Volunteer Management System** (VMS) will
be useful for volunteer coordinators, volunteer sign-up, tracking hours, and 
reporting.

**This project is under active development.**

additional detail on the project's scope.
